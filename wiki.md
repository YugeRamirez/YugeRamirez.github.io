A short description / abstract of the topic you choose. For the text here and below, feel free to use **bold** and *italic* fonts, [linked texts](url),  ![images](url), or any other element you think would be helpful for your audience to understand the topic.


## Basic Description
In general, I don't know what to create, so this is only for me to **practice** my skills on using markdown files.

## My History on Markdown
My first usage on markdown files is **AMATH342** which uses *Jupyter Notebook*, which requires some skills on markdown usage. Links to the classes [AMATH342](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1514011)
