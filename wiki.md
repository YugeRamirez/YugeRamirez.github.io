## Basic Description
In general, I don't know what to create, so this is only for me to **practice** my skills on using markdown files.

## My History on Markdown
My first usage on markdown files is **AMATH342** which uses *Jupyter Notebook*, which requires some skills on markdown usage. Links to the classes [AMATH342](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1514011)
