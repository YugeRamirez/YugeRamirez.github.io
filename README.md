# About the Respository and This Project
## What about this project
- This is for the labs of the GEOG328, Web GIS.
- I don't really understand and agree on using GITHUB, since this is a opensource platform and may risk sharing **school only materials** into public
- However, this is requirment, so I have to stick with it.
